# IT-Infrastructure-Lab

## Project Summary

This project simulates a real-world internal IT network infrastructure using VirtualBox, Ubuntu Server, and multiple Ubuntu client VMs. It integrates core IT services including DNS, DHCP, Samba file sharing, and a web-based help desk system (GLPI). The project is organized into phases and includes automation scripts, documentation, and a clean folder structure to reflect enterprise-level planning and implementation.

##  Setup Instructions

### Virtual Machine Setup
1. **Install VirtualBox**
2. **Create VMs:**
   - `IT-Server`: Ubuntu Server
   - `Client-01`: Ubuntu Desktop
   - `Client-02`: Ubuntu Desktop
3. **Networking:**
   - Configure **Host-Only Adapter** (`vboxnet0`)
   - Ensure all VMs are in the same internal LAN

###  Core Network Services
4. **DNS Setup:**
   - Install `bind9` on IT-Server
   - Configure forward zone: `ns1.internal.lan`
   - Test DNS resolution from clients

5. **DHCP Setup:**
   - Static IP for Client-01
   - Dynamic IP via DHCP for Client-02

6. **Samba Shared Folder:**
   - Guest-access shared directory setup on server
   - Accessible from both client machines

###  Help Desk System (GLPI)
7. **Web Server Stack:**
   - Install Apache, PHP 8.3, and MariaDB
   - Create GLPI database and user
   - Install and configure GLPI 10.0.15
   - Test access at: `http://ns1.internal.lan`

8. **Post-Install Security:**
   - Remove `/install` directory

###  Scripting & Automation
9. **Bash Script:**
   - `ping-check.sh`: Verifies network connectivity
